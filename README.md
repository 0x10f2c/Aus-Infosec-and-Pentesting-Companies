# Aus-Infosec-and-Pentesting-Companies

A list of information security companies that offer penetration testing services and/or other offensive red side orientated services at any level.

Please feel free to submit pull requests to add in companies that may be missing from the list. The list currently doesn't include companies only offering managed services and/or blue side services which is probably a better fit for another list.

N/a - Represents an unknown, if you have information on this please create a pull request.
Furthermore note that size represents the entire company and not just the penetration testing team size. Lastly the size and hiring status are not often updated.
